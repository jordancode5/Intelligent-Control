# ðŸŒ€ Intelligent Control: Inverted Pendulum Balancing

This repository contains the implementation of a classic **inverted pendulum balancing system** using intelligent control techniques. The goal is to maintain an unstable pendulum in an upright position by applying control inputs through a movable cart or robot base. This problem is foundational in control theory and robotics, and serves as a benchmark for evaluating control algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project explores real-time control of an inverted pendulum using:

- âœ… Q - learning
    - pendulum_mk5.py (it is really hard to set up pendulum physics that even try to balance well)
- âœ… Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC)
- âœ… Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- âœ… Simulation in MATLAB and Simulink
- âœ… Optional reinforcement learning and hybrid controllers (WIP) (to be implemented)

The code is modular and can be extended to multiple degrees of freedom or adapted for real hardware platforms (e.g., Arduino + IMU, robotic rovers, or simulation-based RL agents).
